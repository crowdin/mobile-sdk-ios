### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Crowdin iOS SDK? You can start by looking through these `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Good first issue](https://github.com/crowdin/mobile-sdk-ios/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a small amount of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted](https://github.com/crowdin/mobile-sdk-ios/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `Good first issue` issues.

#### Pull Request Checklist

Before sending your pull requests, make sure you followed the list below:

- Read this guidelines.
- Read [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Ensure that your code adheres to standard conventions, as used in the rest of the project.
- Ensure that there are unit tests for your code.
- Run unit tests.

#### Philosophy of code contribution

- Include unit tests when you contribute new features, as they help to a) prove that your code works correctly, and b) guard against future breaking changes to lower the maintenance cost.
- Bug fixes also generally require unit tests, because the presence of bugs usually indicates insufficient test coverage.
