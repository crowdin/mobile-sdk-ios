## Installation

#### Cocoapods

To install CrowdinSDK via [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org), please make shure you have cocoapods installed locally. If not, please install it with following command: ```sudo gem install cocoapods```. 

Detailed instruction can be found [here](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

 To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'CrowdinSDK'
```

To install from cocoapods spec repository (will be avalaible after publishing to cocoapods.):

```
target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'CrowdinSDK'
end
```

To install from gitlab repository (This option will be removed from this document in the future.):

```
target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'CrowdinSDK', :git => 'https://github.com/crowdin/mobile-sdk-ios.git'
end
```


To install from local sources (This option will be removed from this document in the future.):

```
target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'CrowdinSDK', :path => '../../CrowdinSDK' - where '../../CrowdinSDK' is path to local sources.
end
```

After you've added CrowdinSDK to your Podfile, please run ```pod install``` in your project directory, open `App.xcworkspace` and build it. 

## Quick Start

In order to start using CrowdinSDK you need to import and initialize it in your AppDelegate. 

By default, CrowdinSDK uses Crowdin localization provider. In order to properly setup it please read [providers documentation](Documentation/Providers.md). 

Also you can use your own provider implementation. To get the detailed istructions please read [providers documentation](Documentation/Providers.md) or look at 'CustomLocalizationProvider in Example project'.

### Swift

In AppDelegate.swift add ```import CrowdinSDK```.

In ```func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool``` method add: 

```CrowdinSDK.start()```

### Objective-C

In AppDelegate.m add ```@import CrowdinSDK``` or ```#import<CrowdinSDK/CrowdinSDK.h>```.

In ```- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions``` method add: 

```[CrowdinSDK start];```

If you have pure Objective-C project, then you will need to do some additional steps:

- ```$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift/$(PLATFORM_NAME)``` to your Library Search Paths.
- Add ```use_frameworks!``` to your Podfile.

### Example Project

To run the example project, first clone the repo and run `pod install` from the Example directory. All functionality described in this [article](Documentation/TestApplication.md).
