# Crowdin iOS SDK

Crowdin iOS SDK delivers all new translations from Crowdin project to the application immediately. So there is no need to update this application via App Store to get the new version with the localization.

The SDK provides:

* Over-The-Air Content Delivery – the localized content can be sent to the application from the project whenever needed.
* Real-Time Preview – all the translations that are done in the Editor can be shown in your version of the application in real-time. View the translations already made and the ones you're currently typing in.
* Screenshots – all the screenshots made in the application may be automatically sent to your Crowdin project with tagged source strings.
