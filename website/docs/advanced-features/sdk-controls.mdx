# SDK Controls

Crowdin SDK Controls - UI widget that provides quick access to core SDK functionality. This floating widget can be positioned anywhere on the screen and features both expanded and collapsed states. The widget enables direct interaction with key SDK features like translation preview and screenshot capture.

| Collapsed (simple icon)                                                 | Expanded                                                                | Expanded (logged-in)                                                              |

The expanded state provides the following action buttons:

- *Log In/Out*: launch authorization flow or clear user authorization data on logout. Authorization is needed for the *Screenshots* and *Real-Time Preview* features.
- *Real-time preview*: open/close WS connection that is required to work with Crowdin editor. Also, this is using in the "Reload Translations" option.
- *Capture screenshots*: capture a screenshot of the current screen with all the tagged strings and upload it to Crowdin. You'll be prompted to enter a name for the screenshot.
- *Reload Translations*:
  - if Real-Time Preview is ON: it will fetch all the **latest translations** from the Crowdin project and apply them to UI.
  - if Real-Time preview is OFF: it will fetch the translations from the **distribution** and apply them to UI.
- *Logs*: Provides a detailed log of all actions made by SDK (API calls, Content loading, etc). See [Debug and Logging](/guides/debug-and-logging) for more details.
