# SDK Controls

Crowdin SDK Controls - UI widget for easy access to the main features of the Crowdin SDK. The component can be drag-and-dropped to any position of a device's screen, and it has the following states:

| Collapsed (simple icon)                                                 | Expanded                                                                | Expanded (logged-in)                                                              |

The expanded state provides the following action buttons:

- *Log In/Out*: launch authorization flow or clear user authorization data on logout. Authorization is needed for the *Screenshots* and *Real-Time Preview* features.
- *Real-time preview*: open/close WS connection that is required to work with Crowdin editor. Also, this is using in the "Reload Translations" option.
- *Capture screenshots*: capture a screenshot of the current screen with all the tagged strings and upload it to Crowdin.
- *Reload Translations*:
  - if Real-Time Preview is ON: it will fetch all the **latest translations** from the Crowdin project and apply them to UI.
  - if Real-Time preview is OFF: it will fetch the translations from the **distribution** and apply them to UI.
- *Logs*: Provides a detailed log of all actions made by SDK (API calls, Content loading, etc). See [Debug and Logging](/guides/debug-and-logging) for more details.
